            Hi, I'm Fran aka Paka, your professional massage therapist in Berlin. My experience as a dancer has greatly influenced my approach to massage therapy, allowing me to understand the bodyâ€™s movements, tensions, and the need for relaxation deeply.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-heebo leading-relaxed">
            Through my years of dancing, I have developed a keen awareness of how to work with the body to relieve stress and pain. I use my knowledge of movement and anatomy to provide personalized massage treatments that promote healing and well-being. Whether you're an athlete, a dancer, or someone seeking relaxation, my goal is to help you achieve balance and comfort through tailored massage techniques.
          </p>
